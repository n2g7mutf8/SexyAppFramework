a special message from Yalek the Lembine (including the new repo leader n2g7mutf8)

SEXYAPPBASE 1.40 *PLANS*:

This is not a release changelog but a dev log so this way it can be logged into the release with an already written text document.  

There is going to be (and already has been) MASSIVE changes to this library.  We are no longer calling this amazing piece of history "Framework".  It will now be called a "Library".  

Even though most of the code was written to benefit Brian Fiete and the company before the 2010 acqusition, (who is also on here, but not hosting this official repo), there has been some major
features added that will be able to help the user in using this library.

As promised in 1.34 we (have) made new (and still are), piping methods for loading images, and fonts, easier.

Other MAJOR features that will be added (but sadly removed) for 1.40:

DirectX/D2D7 and D3D version 7 will have been depreciated and will no longer be used in this release.
Once again, we are FINALLY making use by replacing this entire library with the major capabilities of D3D9-11 and D2D9-11 by making modern platform games without having to use the directXSDK from the time that Bejeweled 3 1.0 was released (2010).  This will also mean another HUGE change as well:

Under Windows 11: you can finally make use of the Windows 11 SDK for the latest version targets (10.0.22000 and 10.0.22621).  The Windows 11 SDK includes all of the D3D9-11 and D2D/DX9-11 syntax already.  This way you can FINALLY run your games smoothly on Windows 11 and later.  You will also notice an extra version decimal made.  It is for "platform toolset upgrades".  Like this: "1.40.1".  This means the latest toolset was 10.0.22621.  For 1.40.2, this will introduce 23h1 and 23h2 releases, (10.0.22631 ???). Why did (we) decide that?  
Due to how fast tech is changing, we have to adjust for the standards.  

Speaking of standards, this library has been upgraded as well, to VS2022, std::c++17, 20. And std:c18.

WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE ADDED AND CHANGED:

The deletion of most "restrictions".  This includes the PopCap games license, the MP3, OGG, and FMOD.  Once 1.40 is released, the 1.40 changes will explain this massive change.   


FUTURE:  

Another HUGE change and perhaps the biggest one, is a hook to x64 build target platforms instead of win32.  You will still need to use the WinMain/wWinMain functions in your Window/main.cpp files.  But there will be extra conversions that will be done in the assembly functions (from E to R), etc.  Because there are certain assembly variables that will hook on the WinMain function but under the x64 build targets.  This HUGE change will mean much more room for larger memory allocations and address spaces.

We have also noticed a huge vunerability in SexyAppBase.cpp.  It deals with registry entries and we are trying to mitigate that security concern...

FOR THE WIDESTRING: The Widestring variant still needs to be upgraded and processed for the windows 11 OS. 

This is still a WIP and it will take a while.  So please hold your jewels!! We are still making this thing!!

Yalek and n2g7mutf8.
