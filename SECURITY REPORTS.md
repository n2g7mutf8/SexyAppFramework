For 1.40 RC3 and above...

I have now created a document for the user to report various secrity issues that relate to memory leaks, system crashes, and overall general security problems that can cause MAJOR other problems
this library.  

Security issues are to be in this format:
|User| |header/CPP file responsible for the security flaw| |lines of code that represent the security flaw| |the fix to the problem| |version|

We also have numerous resources to report the security flaws that are listed above this document...
Security issues can also be reported to the "Issues" Tab.
