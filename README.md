# SexyAppFramework
The PopCap games framework, named SexyAppFramework, is a flexible high-level library that provides commonly required functions and reusable components, designed to facilitate rapid development of high-quality games.  This is a re-written (from scratch) library, that will use SDL and cross-platform code, and combining WideString and the standalone code into one single action-packed library.

This repository is no-longer maintained. We are working on SexyAppFramework 2x so there is no point of continue this project any more. SexyAppFramework will be public when we have way done.
