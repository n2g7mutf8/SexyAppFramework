# SexyAppFramework
The PopCap games framework, named SexyAppFramework, is a flexible high-level library that provides commonly required functions and reusable components, designed to facilitate rapid development of high-quality games.  This is a re-written (from scratch) library, that will use SDL and cross-platform code, and combining WideString and the standalone code into one single action-packed library.

This (will be) 2.00.  It is not 1.40, 1.50, or even *1.70*.  We will be putting this to 2.00 as we want to ensure that were ahead of the game.  1.70 was sealed away from the public and we cannot find it...

We have also made the official step in making this repository public.  This way the entire face of github can improve it and make it better.  It is no longer proprietary.
As a side note: email n2g7mutf8 if you want push access. It may take a bit for him to respond... We would also rather have your contributions pushed to this repository instead of branching it out, this way it keeps to the popcap coding philosophy.  

We are currently looking for community members to help improve this library and make it a lot better.  As this is a Windows-based static library, we are primarily keeping the focus
on later versions of Windows.  Until we (and you) can figure out cross-platform, feel free to add on to this library.  

All other SexyAppBase branches require configuration changes and "one-way upgrades" to the project properties and they do not conform to the most recent versions.  Please use this repo if you want to develop games under windows 11.  

Please read the "SexyAppBase 2.00".txt for further details.
