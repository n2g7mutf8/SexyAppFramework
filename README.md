# SexyAppFramework
The PopCap game framework, named SexyApp Framework, is a flexible high-level library that provides commonly required functions and reusable components, designed to facilitate rapid development of high-quality games.

This is the latest branch for this framework.  Some stuff is currently being upgraded and updated to meet the newer standards of later OS versions.  
So, some stuff may appear "unstable".
